# Polls2.0
### A version 2.0 of the famous Django polls app tutorial

The app has two frontends that share the same model
1. One built the old fashion way with django templates
2. And the other build with NextJS & DjangoRestFramework API

I have added extra functions to the original django polls app
    Added an API with DRF, and a NextJS client
    Authentication: sign up & login
    ownership of Polls
    permissions, user can't edit a poll which isn't his/hers
    create new polls with the app instead of using the admin site
    etc

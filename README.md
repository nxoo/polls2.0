# Polls2.0
### A version 2.0 of the famous Django polls app tutorial

The app has two frontends that share the same model
1. One built the old fashion way with django templates
2. And the other build with NextJS & DjangoRestFramework API

I have added extra functions to the original django polls app
1. Added an API with DRF, and a NextJS client
2. Authentication: sign up & login
3. ownership of Polls
4. permissions, user can't edit a poll which isn't his/hers
5. create new polls with the app instead of using the admin site
etc
